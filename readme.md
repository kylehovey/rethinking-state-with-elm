# Rethinking State With Elm

Hello! Welcome to the home of my talk/presentation on Elm, a beautiful web framework that was inspired by Haskell and that, in turn, inspired features of Redux and Rust. This repository is both an example application and also contains the presentation.

## Running The Presentation

I wrote the slides using Marp. To view the presentation, either open `index.html` in your browser, or run `marp presentation.md` to regenerate the HTML slides.


## Running The Example App

Make sure you have Elm installed and run `elm reactor` to launch the example app.
